 Backend Development Plan for Beta Release
Target Beta Deadline: Second week of September (by Sep 14, 2025)
 1. Backend Architecture & Technology
Why Microservices?
Weâ€™re building a complex platform that includes user management, feeds/posts, goals, resume scoring, communities, notifications, search, and messaging. A single monolithic application would be challenging to scale and maintain. Microservices offer:
Isolation: Issues or downtime in one component don't affect others.


Scalability: Each component can scale independently.


Maintainability: Easier debugging, testing, and updates.



 Technology Stack (Aligned with Meeting Decisions):
Layer
Selected Technology
Rationale & Benefits
Backend Framework
Jakarta EE (Java Enterprise Edition)
Enterprise-grade stability, native WebSocket, async APIs, MicroProfile for microservices support.
Database
PostgreSQL
Relational data integrity (user profiles, payments, communities) and JSONB for flexible structures.
Real-time Communication
Jakarta EE WebSockets
Low-latency, bidirectional communication ideal for real-time notifications and updates.
Messaging/Event Bus
Apache Kafka
Decoupling services via asynchronous messaging, reliable event-driven architecture.
Caching & Pub/Sub
Redis
Fast in-memory caching (leaderboards, profiles), lightweight real-time notifications.
Search Engine
Elasticsearch
Efficient, powerful full-text search and complex query support for users, posts, and groups.
Authentication
JWT Tokens
Stateless, scalable authentication mechanism.
Password Hashing
Argon2
Highly secure hashing algorithm recommended by OWASP standards.
API Testing & Documentation
Postman & OpenAPI (Swagger)
Automated API tests via Postman collections, clear API documentation via OpenAPI specs.
Infrastructure & Deployment
Docker, Kubernetes (staging/prod), GitHub Actions (Education Pack)
Consistent environment, rapid deployment, free CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions.


 2. Microservices Breakdown & Responsibilities
Each microservice communicates via RESTful APIs, JWT-secured endpoints, and Kafka message events.
Service
Responsibilities
Primary Database
Auth & Users
User registration, login, OAuth, profiles, security, follower relationships.
PostgreSQL
Posts & Feed
Posts, achievements, likes, comments, attachments, real-time feed aggregation.
MongoDB
Goals & Challenges
Goals management, XP scoring, task assignments, challenges and progress tracking.
PostgreSQL
Resume & Scoring
Resume uploads, scoring (stubbed initially), future integration with AI/ML services.
PostgreSQL
Communities & Groups
Community creation, memberships, announcements, leaderboards, chats.
PostgreSQL
Notifications
Real-time notifications for comments, likes, follows, challenges.
Redis
Search
Search functionality across posts, profiles, communities, and challenges.
Elasticsearch
