DETAILED VERSION: 


A social network for all high school and college students who wants to improve themselves.

An app where users can create a profile , upload their resume with proofs and after that a score will be given to their profile and some important things will from their resume will be shown on the profile. If the user is a high school student it can look up scores of all the students applying to the university they want to get in and see their chances for themselves.they can also see scores and profile of students already studying at their dream uni and improve themselves and their profile  through engaging fun activities(like duolingo) and see scores of their friends and create a leaderboard .
For college students they can basically look up companies and people they admire and their scores also the people who has the job they want and various job applications. Etc etc and motivate themselves to push harder in life and find their passion and live the life they desire.
Also compare their scores with their uni students to create a sense of social hierarchy and motivation for every student. And helping them improve.

Problem: people want to change for the best. They don't know how. 


What specific pain points does this app solve that existing platforms (LinkedIn, Duolingo, etc.) do not?

Linkdln is for connecting people and networking purposes its a platform for already focused individuals to showcase their skills. There is no scope of improvement in linkedln. However in our app you can start at any level and we would promise you an improved individual in anything you desire whether its learning or improving your skills  in a fun engaging way. 


How does reducing profiles to a "score" align with the nuanced realities of university admissions or hiring?
Its not about university admissions or hiring…. We focus more on perfection . do not chase the university or the company, develop your skills and master them so they chase you. So the scoring system is just a metric to identify your progress.


What makes this app uniquely motivating compared to traditional mentorship or self-improvement tools?

This app is unique as everyone starts on different levels same as life. However, its the distance of where u started and where u ended. So we just motivate users to improve themselves using gamfying platforms where they have to do the mandatory challenges it could be daily, weekly etc etc depends on their goal. On completing a challenge they earn XP’s which could improve their scores. Their completion is verified on the app or via a certificate or via an online quiz. The users could also be motivated based on their peers improving and other people improving.


Will users control what’s publicly visible (e.g., anonymized profiles vs. full transparency)?
Yes if the user wants it can keep its profile private people wont be able to view it until the user accepts their request. They can also choose to keep it public. However for public profiles, you can create a leaderboard to track progress and invite people.




How will the app mitigate the risk of fostering unhealthy competition or anxiety?
The app’s goal is to focus on improvement rather than reaching a spefic level. So there will be mentors that;ll be guiding them and there will also be a chatbot they can use to ask questions at all times.



What mental health resources will be provided for users feeling demoralized?
No however the user will be getting daily reminders to feel good and one exercise a day for their mental health.


Gamification & Engagement
What activities will qualify as "fun" and educational? How do they tie to tangible growth?

Activities such as group projects for people on the same level. They’ll be getting certificate from us on completing successfully and badges depending on the grade. Also individual projects, courses, quizzes, new hobbies discovering passion etc etc.

How will the app avoid incentivizing superficial "point-chasing" over meaningful progress?
Based on quizzes and online tests, interviews . we’ll know

Will rewards align with long-term goals (e.g., skill badges vs. vanity metrics)?
Yes, users will collection of batches viewable for everyone. It can be in terms of nfts.


How will the app provide actionable steps for improvement beyond showing others’ scores?
